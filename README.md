# stupid-system-info-script-
a simple system info script I wrote in my past time 

running is as easy as 
```bash 
pip3 install psutil colorama termcolor threading pyfiglet
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3r0n3t/stupid-system-info-script-/main/sysinfo.py && chmod +x sysinfo.py
./sysinfo.py

```
#P.S
I know this code as crap and I honestly dont think anyone will ever use this
